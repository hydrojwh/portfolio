> **Note for the CIRES/ESIIL Hiring Committee:** This portfolio provides a brief overview of my projects in scientific software development, hardware automation, and data analysis. I believe my hands-on experience in building end-to-end data systems aligns directly with the innovative spirit of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Impact Lab.

# Woo-Hyun Jeon's Project Portfolio

Hello, I am a Scientist-Entrepreneur passionate about developing solutions for environmental data science and automation. Below are some of my key projects that demonstrate my full-spectrum development capabilities, from hardware to cloud.

### 🚀 Project 1: BiMove (Automatic Vertical Profiling System)

* **Summary:** An automated environmental monitoring system that I designed and built to solve the challenges of manual data acquisition in harsh coastal environments. It enables the collection of high-resolution, long-term hydrogeological data.
* **My Role:** Led the entire end-to-end development, from microcontroller firmware (C++) and hardware design to the desktop control software (Python/C#) and the final data analysis applications (Python/Pandas).
* **Key Technologies:** `Embedded Systems`, `C/C++`, `Python`, `Pandas`, `Hardware Prototyping`, `GUI Development`

### 📱 Project 2: RockSpin (Digital Petrographic Microscope Platform)

* **Summary:** A full-stack application that provides a digital, interactive experience for petrographic microscopy via an iOS app, backed by a scalable cloud infrastructure.
* **My Role:** Acted as the sole Full-Stack Architect, developing the native iOS app (SwiftUI), a React-based admin panel, a secure Node.js backend API, and deploying the entire system on AWS.
* **Key Technologies:** `Swift (iOS)`, `React`, `Node.js`, `AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront)`, `JWT Authentication`
